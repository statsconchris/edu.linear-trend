### A Python code (.ipynb) to predict which teams qualify to the 2018 World Cup in Russia

The file runs in Jupyter Notebook: 

1. lineartrend_EN.ipynb : We plot the FIFA ranking position vs. time of the teams that reached the qualifying playoffs. Moreover we compute a linear approximation using Scipy stats.linregress (), which makes use of the least squares method.

A complete analysis is given in the article: [nepy.pe/en/lineartrend.rusia2018.](http://www.nepy.pe/en/education/linear-trends-to-predict-the-results-of-the-world-cup-qualification-play-offs/) 

A detailed explanation of the least squares method is given in the tutorial: [nepy.pe/en/leastsquares.despacito.](http://www.nepy.pe/en/tutorial/least-squares-method/)
