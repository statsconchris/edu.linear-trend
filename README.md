## Linear trends to predict the results of the FIFA World Cup intercontinental playoffs

Considering linear trends, we correctly predict the results of the 2018 FIFA World Cup intercontinental playoffs. In particular, we show that Sweden would be the big surprise defeating Italy. The code was developed in Python (Jupyter Notebook file).

### Instructions

- Download `lineartrend.ipynb` and run. 

**Note** 
- We plot the FIFA ranking position vs. time of the teams that reached the qualifying playoffs. Moreover we compute a linear approximation using Scipy stats.linregress (), which makes use of the least squares method.

**Information**
- A complete analysis is given in the article: [Linear trends to predict the results of the FIFA World Cup intercontinental playoffs](http://www.nepy.pe/en/education/linear-trends-to-predict-the-results-of-the-world-cup-qualification-play-offs/). 

- A detailed explanation of the least squares method is given in the article: [The least squares method with Despacito](http://www.nepy.pe/en/tutorial/least-squares-method/).
