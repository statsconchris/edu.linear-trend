## Linear trends to predict the results of the FIFA World Cup intercontinental playoffs

Considering linear trends, we correctly predict the results of the 2018 FIFA World Cup intercontinental playoffs. In particular, we show that Sweden would be the big surprise defeating Italy. The code was developed in Python (Jupyter Notebook file).
